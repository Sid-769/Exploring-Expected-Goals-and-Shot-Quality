Tweaking xGOT to analyze shot quality (Top 5 Leagues 22-23 Football Season)
Football Statistics Analysis

Overview

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing football player performances through key metrics like Shot Quality and xGOT. We aim to identify the intricate layers of football statistics and draw insights from the vast data.

Key Features:

Expected Goals:

Expected Goals (xG): A metric that quantifies the quality of a shot based on several variables such as shot angle, distance from goal, and type of pass leading to the shot.

Expected Goals on Target (xGOT): A novel statistic that measures the quality of shots on target and their likelihood to result in goals after the shot is taken.

xGOTop (Open Play): A derivative statistic from xGOT, which eliminates the influence of penalty shots, providing a clearer picture of a player's performance in open-play situations.

Shot Quality: A measure calculated using xGOTop (Open Play) divided by Shots on Target. This provides insights into the quality of shots taken by players based on their placement, power, and precision.

adjSGA (Adjusted Shooting Goals Added): A custom metric that signifies a player's shooting effectiveness when taking into consideration their xG and xGOT values (xGOT - xG).

Insights:

Some players, despite having high Shot Quality or xGOT values, may not rank high in terms of goals scored due to various factors like facing tougher goalkeepers or being unlucky during the match.
Players like Messi, although having high AdjSGA, did not rank among the top goal-scorers, indicating potential factors affecting their goal-scoring prowess.
There's a need to ensure data accuracy and take into account other variables like defensive pressures faced by players when interpreting metrics like Shot Quality.

Future Plans:

Expanding the Dataset: I'll be incorporating multiple datasets in my future analyses to offer a more comprehensive view of the metrics like Shot Quality and adjSGA.

Further Projects: 

In addition to enhancing this analysis, I'll be initiating other projects where my findings will be shared, expanding the horizons of my football statistics journey.
